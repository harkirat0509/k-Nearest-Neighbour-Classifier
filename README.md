# Implementation of k-Nearest Neighbour Classification Model <br/><br/>
## Dataset: Telephone Customers Dataset<br/>
### Model: Classifying customers into four categories based on their attributes<br/>
### Libraries used:<br/>
**Numpy** - For numpy arrays<br/>
**Matplotlib** - For plotting<br/>
**Pandas** - To read data<br/>
**Scikit-Learn** - For calculating accuracy<br/>
*scikit-learn is not used for predicting modelling, parameters have been learnt by writing code from scratch*<br/>

### Description
- Train and Test set has been splited in ratio 80:20.
- Predictions have been made on Test set
- Graph has been plotted between accuracy and k to find optimum value of k to get higher accuracy.
